We used a Trello Board to Keep the Project organized and comunicate with one another, along with our bootcamp slack chanel.

The purpose of this project is to help a user plan out a busy workday. ConfieFoodie, designed to allow the user to click in the empty text and entry box, note appointments, meetings, or to-dos for the day. And the nice thing is that if you click the save button on the side to the right, the information you just typed in for your day is saved in your local storage, so you can review that information until you remove it or change it. I always find myself writing things I need to do down on sticky notes or small pieces of paper, or I think of things I need to do in my head, so they’re scattered. ConfiFoodie would be such a helpful tool to keep everything in one place and map out what you needed to accomplish in your day. I have heard by quite a few people that it helps if you make small, attainable, and achievable goals, and I think this is a ticket to that.
For this group project, we utilized a Trello board to map out our goals and deadlines and manage who would be over which project. We hoped that this would be an easy-to-navigate responsive first and mobile-first design. The purpose of this app was to showcase the ability to call APIs and make them function within a website. For this particular project, we utilized a nutrition API and a weather API. We hoped to give consumers ideas with busy schedules in mind. It can be challenging to plan out meals and even more challenging to take time to make meals when you’re not sure what to plan. We hoped to create something unique. in this instance, we designed a website that can take a consumers location
And customize meals based on the weather. It’s not fun to heat your house in the middle of summer or 100-degree weather. And when it’s cold outside, it’s nice to enjoy warm comfort food.
