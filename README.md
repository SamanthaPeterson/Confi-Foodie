The purpose of this project is to help a user plan out a busy workday. It is designed to allow the user to click in the empty text and entry  box, note appointments, 
Meetings, or to do‘s for the day. And the nice thing is that if you click the save button on the side to the right the information that you just typed in for your day is saved in your local storage so you can review that information until you remove it or change it. 
I always find myself writing things I need to do down on sticky notes or small pieces of paper or I think of things I need to do in my head so they’re scattered. This would be such a helpful tool to keep everything in one place and map out by our what you needed to accomplish in your day. I have heard it said by quite a few people that it helps if you make small attainable and achievable goals and I think this is a ticket to that. 


For this group project we utilized a Trello board to map out our goals and deadlines and to manage who would be over which project. Our hope was that this will be an easy to navigate responsive first and mobile first design. The purpose of this app was to showcase the ability to call APIs and make them function within a website. For this particular project we utilized a nutrition API and a weather API. Our hope was to give consumers ideas with busy schedules in mind. It can be difficult to plan out meals and even more difficult to take time to make meals when you’re not sure what to plan. We hoped to create some thing unique in this instance we designed a website that can take a consumers location

And customize meals based on the weather. It’s not fun to heat up your house in the middle of summer or 100 degree weather. And when it’s cold outside it’s nice to enjoy warm comfort food.
